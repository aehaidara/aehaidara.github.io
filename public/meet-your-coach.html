                                        Growing up in Finland within a multicultural family, I learned the power of
                                        non-judgmental understanding and acceptance. My upbringing developed the ability
                                        to accept people just as they are, regardless of their backgrounds, beliefs, or
                                        differences.
                                        <br>
                                        <br>However, it also fostered the feeling of an outsider. That sense of not
                                        truly belonging became one of the driving forces behind my people-pleasing
                                        tendencies.

                                        and individuality. This transformative experience emphasized adaptability, as I

                                        cultivated skills such as effective self-presentation, adaptability, and

                                        <br>Most importantly, I learned to turn the feeling of being

                                        different.

                                        <br>Being in a relationship teaches you self-discovery, as your partner becomes
                                        the most
                                        effective mirror you'll ever have. It has strengthened my authenticity and

                                        to be my best self for a positive impact on our life.

                                        Another burnout, largely thanks to the chaotic pandemic. This time I was
                                        mature enough to recognize that I had to dig deep to uncover the core roots.
                                        <strong>I was living the life of a people pleaser, someone who struggled to set
                                            boundaries.
                                            Perhaps this rings a familiar bell?</strong>

                                        <br>Therapy and coaching helped me heal and build a more positive life
                                        narrative.
                                        That's when I learned the power of coaching and felt the desire to support
                                        others facing
                                        similar situations. This is how DARA Coaching came to be.
