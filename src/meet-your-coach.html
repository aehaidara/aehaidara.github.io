                                            Growing up in Finland in a
                                            multicultural family, I learned the
                                            power of non-judgmental
                                            understanding and acceptance. My
                                            upbringing developed the ability to
                                            accept people just as they are,
                                            regardless of their backgrounds,
                                            beliefs, or differences.
                                            <br />
                                            <br />However, it also fostered the
                                            feeling of an outsider. That sense
                                            of not truly belonging became one of
                                            the driving forces behind my
                                            people-pleasing tendencies.

                                            During nearly a decade as a model, I
                                            learned the value of embracing my
                                            unique path and individuality. This
                                            transformative experience emphasized
                                            adaptability, as I became a
                                            chameleon in diverse environments.
                                            Stepping beyond my comfort zone, I
                                            cultivated skills such as effective
                                            self-presentation, adaptability and
                                            discipline.

                                            turn the feeling of being an
                                            outsider into a unique superpower,
                                            recognizing the richness of being

                                            Moving to Denmark, where I didn't

                                            culture, marked a big step toward
                                            independence. I worked as a trainer,
                                            focusing on performance-oriented
                                            coaching laying my foundation of

                                            when I experienced burnout. At that
                                            time, I lacked the maturity and

                                            narrative. That's when I learned the
                                            power of coaching and felt the
                                            desire to support others facing
                                            similar situations. This is how DARA
                                            Coaching came to be.
